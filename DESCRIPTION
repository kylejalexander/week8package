Description: This package includes two functions. The first function uses the pythagorean theorem, such that  given the lengths of two sides of the triangle, calculates the length of the third side.  The second function calculates the mean of a numeric vector, ignoring the smallest and largest values - e.g. calculates a trimmed mean.
